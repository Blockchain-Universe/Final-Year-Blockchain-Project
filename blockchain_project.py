# **TOP CLASS BLOCKCHAIN PROJECT**

**Blockchain** is a sequential chain of records called Blocks. They can contain transactions, files, information, records or any data you like, really.
But the important thing is that theyâ€™re chained together using hashes.

See my friend,
I will explain point to point this project.

If you are still not able to understand.

I will send you PPT, Project Report and Video Explanation of this Project.
