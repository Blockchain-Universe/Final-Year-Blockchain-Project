# Final-Year-Blockchain-Project
Top Class Block chain Project for Final Year students. Easy Implementation and Development.

**Blockchain** is an immutable, sequential, contimous chain of records called Blocks. They can contain transactions, records, files or any data you like, really. Most important thing is that theyâ€™re chained together using hashes.
